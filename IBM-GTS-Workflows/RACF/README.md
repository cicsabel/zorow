# PA-zOSMF-Workflows-RACF
z/OSMF workflows for RACF

This repository contains workflow definitions (XML files) that can be used with the Workflows task of the z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF).

In z/OSMF, a workflow is a guided set of steps that help you perform an activity on z/OSÂ®, such as configuring a software product, managing a z/OS resource, or simplifying some relatively complex operation. To support these activities, a workflow can be designed to perform a wide variety of operations, such as starting z/OS subsystems, submitting jobs and scripts, and invoking TSO/E functions.
