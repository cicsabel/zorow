# PA-zOSMF-ZFS-Workflows

z/OSMF workflows for the z/OS platform

This repository contains workflow definitions (XML files) that can be used with the Workflows task of the z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF).

In z/OSMF, a workflow is a guided set of steps that help you perform an activity on z/OSÂ®, such as configuring a software product, managing a z/OS resource, or simplifying some relatively complex operation. To support these activities, a workflow can be designed to perform a wide variety of operations, such as starting z/OS subsystems, submitting jobs and scripts, and invoking TSO/E functions.

<table width=100%><caption>IBM Mainframe Automation team supported workflows</caption>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-CONVERT</td>
      <td>This workflow can be used to convert one or more HFS datasets in ZFS. It is based in the IBM provided BPXWH2Z program. </td>
   </tr> 
   <tr>
	<td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-DEFINE-AMS</td>
	<td>This workflow uses the IDCAMS Access Method Services APIs to define a new ZFS file.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr> 
	<td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-DEFINE </td>
        <td>This workflow uses the tradicional IDCAMS JCL statements as an inline template to define a new ZFS file.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>		      
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-DELETE</td>
      <td>This workflow uses the IDCAMS Access Method Services APIs to delete a ZFS from the system.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-GROW</td>
      <td>This workflow uses the zfsadm command to grow a ZFS aggregate.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-MOUNT</td>
      <td>This workflow uses the zfsadm command to mount a ZFS aggregate.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-PROV-APPL-MOUNTPOINT</td>
      <td>This workflow is a more complex example that combines steps from other workflows contained here, it can be used to
create a new ZFS, a new Unix directory and mount that ZFS on the desired directory.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-SHRINK</td>
      <td>This workflow uses the zfsadm command to shrink a ZFS aggregate.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-AUTO-ZFS-UNMOUNT</td>
      <td>This workflow uses the zfsadm command to Unmount a ZFS aggregate.</td>
   </tr>
</table>

<table width=100%>  <caption>User Contributed Tested Workflows</caption>
   <tr>
      <td>IBM-MF-USR-ZFS-ADDVOL</td>
      <td>This workflow can be used to add more volumes to a given HFS/zFS filesystem so it can expand successfully
   </tr> 
</table>

<table><caption><b>Disclaimer</b></caption>
   <tr>
      <td>All zOSMF Workflows with IBM-MF-AUTO prefix were developed and are supported by Mainframe Service Line Engineering team.</td>
	</tr><tr>
      <td>All zOSMF Workflows with IBM-MF-USR prefix were developed by the z community and shared for global re-use, however there is no ongoing support on them. By uploading the them into your system, you will be responsible to maintain it.</td>
