## z/OSMF workflows for the z/OS platform

This repository contains workflow definitions (XML files) that can be used with the Workflows task of the z/OS Management Facility (z/OSMF).

In z/OSMF, a workflow is a guided set of steps that help you perform an activity on z/OSÂ®, such as configuring a software product, managing a z/OS resource, or simplifying some relatively complex operation. To support these activities, a workflow can be designed to perform a wide variety of operations, such as starting z/OS subsystems, submitting jobs and scripts, and invoking TSO/E functions.

## SLE Developed Workflows:
| File Name | Description | 
| ------    | ------      |
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-CONSCMD|An example on how to call the z/OSMF Consoles REST Interface to issue a MVS command|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-DASDINIT|This workflow can be used to initialize (or format) a dasd **!! USE WITH CAUTION !!**|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-IPLTEXT|This workflow can be used to write IPL Text|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-LINKLIST-ADD|Quickly add a dataset to Linklist|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-LINKLIST-DEL|Quickly delete a dataset from Linklist|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-PDSEMPTY|A workflow designed to delete all members of a Partitioned Dataset **!! USE WITH CAUTION !!**|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-REXXVARS|An example on how to manipulate workflow variables in REXX using a properties file, this was a little hard to figure out because of the lack of documentation of the $_output function, it is only fair that I share this|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-SADMP|This workflow will initialize the volumes, create the new SYS1.SADMP stripe dataset and the SAD program plus IPL Text|
|IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-SADMP.txt|**Optional** Sample input file to use with IBM-MF-AUTO-ZOS-SADMP.xml workflow|

## User Contributed Code:
| File Name | Description | 
| ------    | ------      |
|IBM-MF-USR-ZOS-ADD-LOCAL-PAGE-DATASET|This workflow can be used to add a new Local Page Space dataset to be used when increase of auxiliary storage is required.|

* All zOSMF Workflows with **IBM-MF-AUTO prefix** were developed and are supported by Mainframe Service Line Engineering team.
* All zOSMF Workflows with **IBM-MF-USR prefix** were developed by the z community and shared for global re-use, however there is no ongoing support on them. By uploading the them into your system, you will be responsible to maintain it.
